# OpenGL-6th-SEM-

These projects have been tested on linux systems which have code-blocks installed. 
This setup is as shown here: http://ehowplus.com/articles/setting-opengl-ubuntu-14-04/
This links works well in 14.10 and 15.04 versions of ubuntu also.

A shift to other operating systems or linux command line should not be much of a problem. Little modification is required to do so.

These porjects help you to better understand basic OpenGL functions like mouse, keyboard, window etc. 
It also gives an idea about the different types of lighting, views and other concepts. 

There are a few glitches in the code. 
Ex: In bouncing shapes, once squares are displayed it doesn't go on to display circles upon pressing 'c'. But it works fine when you press 's' when circles are displayed.
Push if you get to know the problem. :P
